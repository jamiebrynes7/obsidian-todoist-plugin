# Overview

The Sync with Todoist Plugin is an _**unofficial**_ plugin that allows you to integrate your Todoist tasks in your Obsidian vault. This integration is mostly one way, from Todoist into Obsidian. There is a limited ability to modify your Todoist tasks, but this functionality will be improved in the future.

This plugin is designed to work on both desktop and mobile Obsidian clients.

## Installation

There are a few steps to getting up and running with this plugin:

1. Install the plugin from Obsidian in the 'Community plugins' tab in the settings.
2. After installing the plugin, enable it.
3. You will get a prompt after enabling the plugin asking for your Todoist API token. You can find this in the [Todoist application settings](https://app.todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/developer).
4. Enter your token and select 'Submit'.

## What's next?

Once you've set up the plugin you can explore adding [query blocks](./query-blocks), look at how to [add tasks from Obsidian](./commands/add-task), or explore the [plugin configuration](./configuration).

# Overview

The Sync with Todoist Plugin is an _**unofficial**_ plugin that allows you to integrate your Todoist tasks in your Obsidian vault. This integration is mostly one way, from Todoist into Obsidian. There is a limited ability to modify your Todoist tasks, but this functionality will be improved in the future.

This plugin is designed to work on both desktop and mobile Obsidian clients.

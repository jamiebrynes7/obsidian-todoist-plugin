# Obsidian x Todoist Plugin

![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/jamiebrynes7/obsidian-todoist-plugin/premerge?style=for-the-badge) ![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/jamiebrynes7/obsidian-todoist-plugin?style=for-the-badge)

An experimental [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to materialize [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) task lists in Obsidian notes.

_Tested with Obsidian 0.10.3 your results may vary!_

## Usage

1. Download `main.js` and `manifest.json` from the [latest release](https://github.com/jamiebrynes7/obsidian-todoist-plugin/releases).
2. Place this into your `${OBSIDIAN_VAULT}/.obsidian/plugin/todoist-sync` directory.
3. Open Obsidian and ensure that the Todoist plugin is enabled.
4. You should get a prompt asking for your [Todoist API token](https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations). (If not, you can enter this in the settings).
5. Place a code block like the following in any note:
   ````markdown
   ```todoist
   {
   "name": "My Tasks",
   "filter": "today | overdue"
   }
   ```
   ````
6. Swap to preview mode and the plugin should replace this code block with the materialized result of that filter.

> If you are synchronizing your vault, I recommend explicitly ignoring the `.obsidian/todoist-token` file for security reasons, if possible.

| `filter`      |    ✓     | A valid [Todoist filter](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205248842-Filters)<sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup> | string   |         |
| `autorefresh` |          | The number of seconds between auto-refreshing. If omitted, the query use the default global settings.             | number   | null    |
| `sorting`     |          | Describes how to order the tasks in the query. Can be any of 'priority' or 'date', or multiple.                   | string[] | []      |
| `group`       |          | Denotes whether this query should have its task grouped by project & section.                                     | bool     | false   |

## Commands

There are also a few commands bundled in with the plugin:

1. 'Refresh Metadata'

   This command refreshes all the metadata (projects, sections, and labels) for Todoist tasks. This is done at startup.

2. 'Add Todoist task'

   This command opens up a modal for creating a task in Todoist. You can set the project/section, labels, and due date through this modal. Any text selected when this command is executed will be pulled for the task content.

## CSS

This plugin comes with default CSS intended for use with the default Obsidian themes.

I also maintain an Obsidian theme which has support out of the box for this plugin, for a complete example of CSS for this plugin, check out [the source](https://github.com/jamiebrynes7/moonlight-obsidian-theme/blob/master/src/modules/extensions/todoist.scss).

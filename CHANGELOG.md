## Unreleased

### ✨ Features

- Rebuilt the onboarding modal that users are presented with upon installing the plugin. This now offers feedback to users based on the token they've provided.
  - We also no longer use a native browser alert if the token isn't present. Instead, we prefer to open the modal each time Obsidian is opened if there is no valid token.
- Rebuilt the settings page from scratch. It is now divided into sections to organize the settings.
  - Now includes useful links to documentation and GitHub issues.
  - API token validation is done in the settings page with an option to open the modal if the validation fails.
- You can now group by different task properties like: priority, due date, and others. Please see the [documentation](https://jamiebrynes7.github.io/obsidian-todoist-plugin/docs/query-blocks#groupBy) for more details.
- Rebuilt the add task dialog from scratch. This should fix a number of bugs with the date picker, improves the UX, and brings it inline with the native Todoist experience.
- Added a new command 'Add task with current page in task description' which offers the ability to append a link to the current page to the task description when it is created.
- Added support for adding time to due dates in the "create task" modal.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- The `priorityAscending` and `priorityDescending` options now sort tasks in the correct order.

## [1.12.0] - 2024-02-09

> Note: the style changes in this release mean that you may need to tweak any custom CSS or themes. The changes are based on the default theme.

### Deprecated

- Please note that the "Render Descriptions", "Render Dates", "Render project & section", and "Render labels" settings are now deprecated. You can now control whether these render or not via the `show` property in the query itself. These will be removed in a future release.

### ✨ Features

- Added the option to wrap page links in parenthesis when creating tasks with the command. You may find this useful if you primarily use Todoist on mobile where links are less obvious. Thanks to [@ThDag](https://github.com/ThDag) for the contribution!
- You can now use the `{{filename}}` placeholder in the filter property. This will be replaced with the name of the file where the query is defined.
  - For example, if the full file path is `My Vault/Notes/How to Take Smart Notes.md` then the replaced file name will be `How to Take Smart Notes`.
- Added "Add item" button to rendered queries. This will open the task creation modal.
- Added the ability to control which elements of the task metadata render with tasks inside the query with the `show` keyword.
- You can now sort by when the task was added to Todoist using `dateAdded` and `dateAddedAscending` sort options.
- The div rendered when there are no tasks returned by a query now has a `todoist-no-tasks` class to allow you to customize the CSS.

### 🔁 Changes

- You can now toggle whether or not task descriptions are rendered for each task.
- Change the style of the sync button to match the Obsidian style of the "edit" codeblock button.
- Fix intent level to match standard markdown levels in order to have consistent style.
- Aligned the grouping behaviour with Todoist's when grouping by project. This will be expanded on in a future release.
- Changed all icons to be part of the Lucide set to align with Obsidian.
- The `title` part of the query is now optional.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Opening tasks via the context menu should now work properly on mobile devices.

## [1.11.1] - 2023-04-09

### ✨ Features

- You can now use YAML for writing your Todoist queries.
- Tasks that are due today now have the `task-today` CSS class.
- Task descriptions are now rendered with the task.
  - If the description is multiple lines or has complex Markdown, it is rendered as a preview.
  - The preview can be expanded and closed by double-clicking on the preview.
- The task description can now be set from the 'Add Todoist task' modal.

### 🔁 Changes

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Using the 'Add Todoist Task' command should correctly use the selection in an editor pane.
- Subtask lists should no longer display erroneous messages when all the subtasks are closed.
- Fixed logical bugs in handling failures when marking a task as done.

### ⚙ Internal

- Ensured that all API requests to Todoist have debug & error logging.

- Requests to Todoist's API should no longer fail CORS checks.

## [1.10.0] - 2022-10-17

- This plugin's default styles updated to the new theme in Obsidian v1.0.

### 🔁 Changes

- The priority CSS classes now appear on the outer `div` for a given task. This should allow you to style the entire task, not just the checkbox/description.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- The plugin should now respect your Vault configuration directory when saving your Todoist token.

### ⚙ Internal

- This plugin now uses the Todoist REST API v2. [Thanks to @gnapse](https://github.com/gnapse)!

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Right-click context menu now works with the latest Obsidian version.

## [1.7.0] - 2021-01-24

### ✨ Features

- Markdown within tasks is now rendered as part of the task. This means that bold, italics and inline code blocks are supported, as are links (both internal and external).
- Uncompletable tasks have a `disabled` checkbox, this may look different depending on your theme, but it will stop you completing these tasks accidentally.
- You can now template the number of tasks returned by the query in the query name by using `{task_count}`
  - For example, setting the name to `Tasks ({task_count})` will render as `Tasks (10)` if there are 10 tasks returned by the query.
- Right clicking on a task will now open a context menu where you can either complete the task or open it in the browser or application.

## [1.6.2] - 2021-01-13

### 🔁 Changes

- Removed built-in update checker as Obsidian has one for plugins now!

## [1.6.1] - 2021-01-06

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Refreshing tasks no longer causes any existing task to disappear and then reappear.
- Use `MarkdownRenderChild` correctly to prevent potential memory leaks.

## [1.6.0] - 2020-12-31

### ✨ Features

- A long awaited and requested feature is finally here! You can create Todoist tasks from within Obsidian.
  - This is accessible through a command which will open a modal for the task details.
  - There is a second command which will append the link to the current active page at the end of the Todoist task.
  - Any selected text under the cursor will be pre-filled as the task text.
  - This does _not_ support Todoist's syntax such as '#' for projects, '@' for labels, and smart date recognition.
- Improved the setup of the plugin. Now the plugin will prompt you for an API token on launch and you can set the token through the settings.
- There is now a message rendered if your query returns no tasks.
- Add default CSS for the default Obsidian theme.

### 🔁 Changes

- The 'Refresh Metadata' command no longer has a duplicate 'Todoist' identifier in front of it.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

## [1.5.0] - 2020-10-31

### ✨ Features

- This plugin is now compatible with the [official Obsidian API](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api). It was developed against Obsidian 0.9.10.

## [1.4.0] - 2020-10-19

Along with this release, I've released an Obsidian theme which has built-in support for this plugin! 🎉

Check it out at [jamiebrynes7/moonlight-obsidian-theme](https://github.com/jamiebrynes7/moonlight-obsidian-theme)!

### ✨ Features

- The version of the plugin is now displayed in the settings tab along with a link to the changelog.
- You can specify that the result of a query should be grouped by project & section. To do this, add the `"group": true` field to the JSON query.
  ```json
  {
    "name": "My Tasks",
    "filter": "today | overdue",
    "group": true
  }
  ```
- You can now check for plugin updates in the Todoist plugin settings.
- The JSON query is now validated and errors are presented in a more user-friendly fashion:
  ![Query parsing error example](./assets/query-parsing-error-example.png)
- Any `workspace-leaf` which has an injected query will have the `contains-todoist-query` CSS class attached. This allows you to style these leafs independently of the others.

### 🔃 Changed

- Errors are displayed more prominently in the injected Todoist query.

### ⚙ Internal

- Added the ability to turn on debug logging in the plugin.

## [1.3.1] - 2020-09-18

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the 'Render labels' setting did not work.

## [1.3.0] - 2020-09-17

### ✨ Features

- Tasks now render labels under them by default. This can be toggled in the settings (along with the accompanying icon).
- Tasks now render projects & section under them by default. This can be toggled in the settings (along with the accompanying icon).

  - The layout of the project, date, and label combo can be configured in CSS. For example:

    ```css
    /* To make date & project sit inline */
    .task-metadata {
      display: inline;
    }

    /* To make date & project sit on top of each other. */
    .task-metadata {
      display: block;
    }
    ```

- There is a new command `Todoist: Refresh Metadata` which will re-fetch your projects, sections, and labels. If you add/remove/rename these, you should refresh the metadata. This is done automatically at startup.
- Added `contains-task-list` to match latest Obsidian styling.
- The entire task (`li` element) has the `task-overdue` class on it, in addition to the date element specifically.
- The task (`li` element) has either `has-time` or `has-no-time` derived from the date field. (No date or time will also have `has-no-time`).
- Add support for Obsidian v0.8.14

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where tasks with datetimes were sometimes sorted incorrectly.

## [1.2.2] - 2020-09-06

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the `task-overdue` status would disappear if a task above it was checked off.

## [1.2.1] - 2020-09-06

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where subtasks would cause errors with sorting.

## [1.2.0] - 2020-09-05

### ✨ Features

- Subtasks are now nested under their parent if both are included in the filter. If a subtask is captured by a filter, but the parent is not, it will be listed as a top level item. You may need to adjust your priority CSS to accommodate these changes. For example:
  ```diff
  + .todoist-p1 > input[type="checkbox"] {
  - .todoist-p1 input[type="checkbox"] {
      /* This matches against the input element rendered for a priority 1 task. */
  }
  ```
- Tasks now render dates under them by default. This can be toggled in the settings (along with some the accompanying icon). If you choose to use icons, I recommend you _at least_ add the following CSS to your own (tweaking may be required based on your theme):
  ```css
  .task-calendar-icon {
    vertical-align: middle;
    height: 17px;
    width: 17px;
  }
  ```
- Added support for controlling the ordering of the rendered tasks. This can be done by either priority or date, or a combination of them (e.g. - sort by priority, then by date). To use this feature, amend your queries:
  ````markdown
  ```json
  {
    "name": "My Tasks",
    "filter": "today | overdue",
    "autorefresh": 30,
    "sorting": ["date", "priority"]
  }
  ```
  ````

### ⚙ Internal

- Ported the plugin to (almost entirely) Typescript.

## [1.1.0] - 2020-08-31

### ✨ Features

- Each rendered task's CSS now contains information about the task's priority. You can use this information to style each priority differently. These classes are `todoist-p1`, `todoist-p2`, `todoist-p3`, and `todoist-p4`. For example:
  ```css
  .todoist-p1 input[type="checkbox"] {
    /* This matches against the input element rendered for a priority 1 task. */
  }
  ```
- When a task is removed or added, it now transitions with a smooth fading effect, rather than immediately being added/removed. This can be turned off in the settings.
- Added support for auto-refreshing queries. This can be set at a global level within the settings tab or overridden for each individual query. For example:
  ````markdown
  ```json
  {
    "name": "My Tasks",
    "filter": "today | overdue",
    "autorefresh": 30
  }
  ```
  ````
- Added a setting tab in the Obsidian setting menu. There are three settings included in this release:
  - "Task fade animation" - controls whether to use the fade animation
  - "Auto-refresh" - controls whether all queries should auto-refresh
  - "Auto-refresh interval" - controls the default interval for auto-refreshing queries

### 🔃 Changes

- The rendered task list now uses the ordering as defined by the Todoist API.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- The injected Todoist query components are correctly destroyed when removed from the DOM.

## [1.0.0] - 2020-08-29

This was the initial release of the Obsidian x Todoist plugin. It contained the basic functionality for:

- materializing tasks in an Obsidian note
- allowing you to check tasks off from an Obsidian note

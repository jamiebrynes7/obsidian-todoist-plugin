## [Unreleased]

### âœ¨ Features

- Each rendered task now contains information about the task's priority. You can use this information to style each priority differently. These classes are `todoist-p1`, `todoist-p2`, `todoist-p3`, and `todoist-p4`. For example: 
    ```css
    .todoist-p1 input[type=checkbox] {
        /* This matches against the input element rendered for a priority 1 task. */
    }
    ```

### ðŸ”ƒ Changes

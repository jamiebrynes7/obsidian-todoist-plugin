# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.0] - 2020-09-17

### ‚ú® Features

- Tasks now render labels under them by default. This can be toggled in the settings (along with the accompanying icon).
- Tasks now render projects & section under them by default. This can be toggled in the settings (along with the accompanying icon).

  - The layout of the project, date, and label combo can be configured in CSS. For example:

    ```css
    /* To make date & project sit inline */
    .task-metadata {
      display: inline;
    }

    /* To make date & project sit on top of each other. */
    .task-metadata {
      display: block;
    }
    ```

- There is a new command `Todoist: Refresh Metadata` which will re-fetch your projects, sections, and labels. If you add/remove/rename these, you should refresh the metadata. This is done automatically at startup.
- Added `contains-task-list` to match latest Obsidian styling.
- The entire task (`li` element) has the `task-overdue` class on it, in addition to the date element specifically.
- The task (`li` element) has either `has-time` or `has-no-time` derived from the date field. (No date or time will also have `has-no-time`).
- Add support for Obsidian v0.8.14

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where tasks with datetimes were sometimes sorted incorrectly.

## [1.2.2] - 2020-09-06

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the `task-overdue` status would disappear if a task above it was checked off.

## [1.2.1] - 2020-09-06

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where subtasks would cause errors with sorting.

## [1.2.0] - 2020-09-05

### ‚ú® Features

- Subtasks are now nested under their parent if both are included in the filter. If a subtask is captured by a filter, but the parent is not, it will be listed as a top level item. You may need to adjust your priority CSS to accommodate these changes. For example:
  ```diff
  + .todoist-p1 > input[type="checkbox"] {
  - .todoist-p1 input[type="checkbox"] {
      /* This matches against the input element rendered for a priority 1 task. */
  }
  ```
- Tasks now render dates under them by default. This can be toggled in the settings (along with some the accompanying icon). If you choose to use icons, I recommend you _at least_ add the following CSS to your own (tweaking may be required based on your theme):
  ```css
  .task-calendar-icon {
    vertical-align: middle;
    height: 17px;
    width: 17px;
  }
  ```
- Added support for controlling the ordering of the rendered tasks. This can be done by either priority or date, or a combination of them (e.g. - sort by priority, then by date). To use this feature, amend your queries:
  ````markdown
  ```json
  {
    "name": "My Tasks",
    "filter": "today | overdue",
    "autorefresh": 30,
    "sorting": ["date", "priority"]
  }
  ```
  ````

### ‚öô Internal

- Ported the plugin to (almost entirely) Typescript.

## [1.1.0] - 2020-08-31

### ‚ú® Features

- Each rendered task's CSS now contains information about the task's priority. You can use this information to style each priority differently. These classes are `todoist-p1`, `todoist-p2`, `todoist-p3`, and `todoist-p4`. For example:
  ```css
  .todoist-p1 input[type="checkbox"] {
    /* This matches against the input element rendered for a priority 1 task. */
  }
  ```
- When a task is removed or added, it now transitions with a smooth fading effect, rather than immediately being added/removed. This can be turned off in the settings.
- Added support for auto-refreshing queries. This can be set at a global level within the settings tab or overridden for each individual query. For example:
  ````markdown
  ```json
  {
    "name": "My Tasks",
    "filter": "today | overdue",
    "autorefresh": 30
  }
  ```
  ````
- Added a setting tab in the Obsidian setting menu. There are three settings included in this release:
  - "Task fade animation" - controls whether to use the fade animation
  - "Auto-refresh" - controls whether all queries should auto-refresh
  - "Auto-refresh interval" - controls the default interval for auto-refreshing queries

### üîÉ Changes

- The rendered task list now uses the ordering as defined by the Todoist API.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- The injected Todoist query components are correctly destroyed when removed from the DOM.

## [1.0.0] - 2020-08-29

This was the initial release of the Obsidian x Todoist plugin. It contained the basic functionality for:

- materializing tasks in an Obsidian note
- allowing you to check tasks off from an Obsidian note
